# P2P File Backup Service

This repository holds two implementations of a peer-to-peer distributed backup service that supports the backup, restore, and deletion of files. The first implementation provides a service where computers in the same local area network LAN can be used to back up files. The second project uses a design based on the Chord algorithm and aims to provide a backup service across the internet. Both projects were developed for the course on Distributed Systems at FEUP.
*For a detailed description of each project, please refer to the respective directories, namely [`proj1-backup-service`](https://github.com/dianaamfr/P2P-Backup-Service/tree/master/proj1-backup-service) and [`proj2-chord-backup-service`](https://github.com/dianaamfr/P2P-Backup-Service/tree/master/proj2-chord-backup-service)*, where you can find the source code, instructions, and report of each project.
